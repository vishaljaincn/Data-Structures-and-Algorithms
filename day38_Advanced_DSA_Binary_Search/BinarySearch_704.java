/*
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 */

// Time complexity: O(log n), where n is the size of the sorted array.
// Space complexity: O(1), constant space used for pointers and variables.

            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid; // Target found, return the index

                left = mid + 1; // Search in the right half
            } else {
                right = mid - 1; // Search in the left half
