/*
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence,
return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted
without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

/*
Time Complexity: O(N*M)

Reason: There are N*M states therefore at max ‘N*M’ new problems will be solved.

Space Complexity: O(N*M) + O(N+M)

Reason: We are using an auxiliary recursion stack space(O(N+M))
(see the recursive tree, in the worst case, we will go till N+M calls at a time) and a 2D array ( O(N*M)).
